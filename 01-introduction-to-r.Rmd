## Installing R and RStudio {#install-r}

Steps in installing R and RStudio (and other required software) for Windows machines

Following is a simple guide to installing R and RStudio and other required software on Windows machines for the specific purpose of the Seychelles Ministry of Health training.

### 1. Install R

Important that R is installed first. R is the main software and is needed for RStudio to work properly. R should always be installed first.

Go to https://cran.r-project.org

Click on link that says Download R for Windows

Then click on the link that says install R for the first time

Then click on Download R-4.2.0 for Windows. This will start the download process.

Once downloaded, go to the exe file in your Downloads folder, double-click and follow all the install prompts, selecting recommended options all the time

### 2. Install RStudio

This step requires that step 1 has been done and was successful.

Go to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

Select the download specific for your machine. If Windows - use this link to download - https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/windows/RStudio-2022.02.2-485.exe

Once downloaded, double-click on exe file downloaded to your Downloads folder and then follow all install prompts, always selecting recommended options.

### 3. Install Rtools

For the things that I will be teaching you, we will need to expand the installation of R by installing the Rtools software from R.

The download link is https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools42/rtools.html if you have installed R version 4.2.0

Once you have downloaded the exe file, double-click on the exe file and follow all install prompts. Choose all the recommended options.

### 4. Install Git for Windows

For the things that I will be teaching you, we will need to install Git for Windows.

If your machine is 64-bit machine (most likely the case if your computer is new and running Windows 10 or later) - use this download link - https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.36.0.windows.1/Git-2.36.0-64-bit.exe

If your machine is 32-bit machine - use this link - https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.36.0.windows.1/Git-2.36.0-32-bit.exe

Once you have downloaded the exe file, double-click it and then follow all install prompts. Choose all recommended options.

## What is R? {#what-r}

`R` is a system for data manipulation, calculation, and graphics. It provides:

* Facilities for data handling and storage

* A large collection of tools for data analysis

* Graphical facilities for data analysis and display

* A simple but powerful programming language

`R` is often described as an environment for working with data. This is in contrast to a *package* which is a collection of very specific tools. `R` is not strictly a statistics system but a system that provides many classical and modern statistical procedures as part of a broader data-analysis tool. This is an important difference between `R` and other statistical systems. In `R` a statistical analysis is usually performed as a series of steps with intermediate results being stored in objects. Systems such as `SPSS` and `SAS` provide copious output from (e.g.) a regression analysis whereas `R` will give minimal output and store the results of a fit for subsequent interrogation or use with other `R` functions. This means that `R` can be tailored to produce exactly the analysis and results that you want rather than produce an analysis designed to fit all situations.

`R` is a language based product. This means that you interact with `R` by typing commands such as: 

&nbsp;

```{r, eval = FALSE}
table(SEX, LIFE)
```

&nbsp;

rather than by using menus, dialog boxes, selection lists, and buttons. This may seem to be a drawback but it means that the system is considerably more flexible than one that relies on menus, buttons, and boxes. It also means that every stage of your data management and analysis can be recorded and edited and re-run at a later date. It also provides an audit trail for quality control purposes.

`R` is available under UNIX (including Linux), the Macintosh operating system OS X, and Microsoft Windows. The method used for starting `R` will vary from system to system. On UNIX systems you may need to issue the `R` command in a terminal session or click on an icon or menu option if your system has a windowing system. On Macintosh systems `R` will be available as an application but can also be run in a terminal session. On Microsoft Windows systems there will usually be an icon on the Start menu or the desktop.

## Why use R? {#why-r}

`R` is an open source system and is available under the *GNU general public license* (GPL) which means that it is available for free but that there are some restrictions on how you are allowed to distribute the system and how you may charge for bespoke data analysis solutions written using the `R` system. Details of the general public license are available from http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html.

`R` is available for download from http://www.r-project.org/.

This is also the best place to get extension packages and documentation. You may also subscribe to the `R` mailing lists from this site. `R` is supported through mailing lists. The level of support is at least as good as for commercial packages. It is typical to have queries answered in a matter of a few hours.

Even though `R` is a free package it is more powerful than most commercial packages. Many of the modern procedures found in commercial packages were first developed and tested using `R` or **S-Plus** (the commercial equivalent of `R`).

## What is RStudio {#what-rstudio}

RStudio is an **integrated development environment (IDE)** for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.

RStudio is available in open source and commercial editions and runs on the desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux) or in a browser connected to RStudio Server or RStudio Workbench (Debian/Ubuntu, Red Hat/CentOS, and SUSE Linux).
